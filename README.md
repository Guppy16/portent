### Eth Oxford 2025 Hackathon

This repo is prepared in submission for _eth-Oxford-2025_ hackathon.

We are submitting into the [AI track](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/eth-oxford-2025/ai) with the aim for the **Wildcard** Prize, specifically to tackle this task: _AI for predictive analytics in decentralized markets_. We built our own AI agent to consistently predict the price movement based on key real world events, and have an NLP interface to interact with the agent. Agentic flow is automatic..

We are also submitting for [Flare](https://flare-network.notion.site/Flare-Hackathon-Guide-ETH-Oxford-17fd502e6fa6803ab4fefd325eb2395f) Track. As a proof concept, we use the Flare Data Connector (FDC) protocol to attest **both** the data that we fetch from NYT and our own backend data which would be updated daily based on the news. The smart contract is deployed on [coston2](https://coston2-explorer.flare.network/) at [0xd1F1BE685Fd67F8561BeC1281C714c6a14Eb6baD](https://coston2-explorer.flare.network/address/0xd1F1BE685Fd67F8561BeC1281C714c6a14Eb6baD#code) example of an attestation submission [here](https://coston2-systems-explorer.flare.rocks/voting-epoch/896247?tab=fdc). 


### Next steps

We are looking to launch this as a vertical and focus on the following:
- **On-Chain** and **Agentic NLP**
  - Reliable and secure price history from _Flare_
  - Curate diverse news sources and store the data on _BNB Greenfield_
  - Integrate this with our conversational AI meta agent
